- **Local Logging**: Logs are stored locally in the `log.txt` file, capturing activities like credential generation.

### Cooldown Management

Cooldowns for credential generation are managed through the `users.json` file. This file keeps track of which users have generated credentials and limits them from generating multiple sets.

### Matplotlib for Stats

The bot uses `matplotlib` to generate usage stats graphs for admins. These graphs are embedded into the bot's responses as images.

## Running the Bot

To run the bot, simply execute the following command:
```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will sync its commands with your Discord server and become available to respond to interactions.
